# Crysis-Wars-Source-Code
Original, unedited source-code for budding modders out there.

Originally created in order to aid those [attempting to fix the 'SwapEndian' error with C++11 and later versions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24580523/swapendian-doesnt-work-in-c11-what-changed) (link points to a question on Stack Overflow by me), but also because I keep losing the original source-code :-).

Feel free to fork and create your own game mod :-).
